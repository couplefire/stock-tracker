# Stock Tracker Configuration for Low Resources
MAX_CONCURRENT_CHECKS=1    # Keep at 1 to prevent multiple browser instances
CHECK_INTERVAL=60          # Check items every 60 seconds (adjust based on needs)

# Performance Notes:
# - Browser instances are pooled and reused to minimize memory usage
# - Items are checked one at a time with rate limiting
# - Force checks are queued rather than executed immediately
# - Page load timeouts reduced to 20 seconds to fail fast
